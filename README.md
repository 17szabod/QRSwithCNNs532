# QRS Biological Background:
Your heart beats in a cadence due to naturally occuring electrical signals. The signal originates and is triggered at the SA node near the top of your heart. The electrical pulse then flows through your heart, ultimately causing the ventricles to contract and send blood pulsing through the arteries. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a reading of the electrical activity of the heart, presented as a waveform (commonly measured in millivolts) over time. The interpretation of these waveforms has been a staple in medical examination and monitoring of a patient's health. (insert example image of an ecg waveform with labeled waves) The waveform can be analyzed through labeling different pieces, the most prominent being the QRS complex. The QRS complex signifies the depolarization and contraction of the ventricles, or the moment of a single, physical "beat" of the heart. An arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat, meaning a person's body is not receiving proper blood flow, which can lead to severe outcomes. Arrhythmias should be caught and responded to as quickly as possible to reduce health risk. An ECG can reveal arrhythmias, though interpretation can be difficult and detailed. Training convolutional neural networks to distinguish a healthy ECG signal against an arrhythmia would greatly benefit response time and diagnostic confidence in the medical field.
